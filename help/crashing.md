# Crashing

All scripts are rated for executors that are level 4-5 so there are 2 other things that might be the problem.

1. Your computer is too laggy and roblox will crash due to the lag, roblox trying to block an injection of our script will lag anyone's game for up to 5 seconds.
2. Your executor is not high enough level. Vega X is currently the lowest level executor that all scripts work with that have been tested.
